abstract="In the digital era, individuals are increasingly profiled and grouped based on the traces that they leave behind in online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a novel text analysis approach for studying user identity and social roles by redefining identity as a sequence of timestamped items (e.g., tweet texts). We operationalise this idea by developing a novel text distance metric, the time-sensitive semantic edit distance (t-SED), which accounts for the temporal context across multiple traces. To evaluate this method, we undertake a case study of Russian online-troll activity within US political discourse. The novel metric allows us to classify the social roles of trolls based on their traces, in this case tweets, into one of the predefined categories left-leaning, right-leaning, and news feed. We show the effectiveness of the t-SED metric to measure the similarities between tweets while accounting for the temporal context, and we use novel data visualisation techniques and qualitative analysis to uncover new empirical insights into Russian troll activity that have not been identified in the previous work. In addition, we highlight a connection with the field of actor--network theory and the related hypotheses of Gabriel Tarde, and we discuss how social sequence analysis using t-SED may provide new avenues for tackling a longstanding problem in social theory: how to analyse society without separating reality into micro vs. macro-levels.",

The model is based on a learned edit distance mechanism which generalises a classic recursion from computer science, leading to a neural dynamic program. Repeated motifs are detected by learning the transformations between them. We represent the arising computational dependencies using a novel data structure, the edit tree; this perspective suggests natural approximations which afford the scaling up of our otherwise cubic time algorithm. We demonstrate our model on real and synthetic data; in all cases it out-performs a strong stacked long short-term memory benchmark.}

Current prediction techniques for PSTs rely on exact matching between the suffix of the current sequence and the previously observed sequence. We present a provably correct algorithm for learning a PST with approximate suffix matching by relaxing the exact matching condition. We then present a self-bounded enhancement of our algorithm where the depth of suffix tree grows automatically in response to the model performance on a training sequence. Through experiments on synthetic datasets as well as three real-world datasets, we show that the approximate matching PST results in better predictive performance than the other variants of PST.}

abstract="We present the hierarchical Dirichlet scaling process (HDSP), a Bayesian nonparametric mixed membership model. The HDSP generalizes the hierarchical Dirichlet process to model the correlation structure between metadata in the corpus and mixture components. We construct the HDSP based on the normalized gamma representation of the Dirichlet process, and this construction allows incorporating a scaling function that controls the membership probabilities of the mixture components. We develop two scaling methods to demonstrate that different modeling assumptions can be expressed in the HDSP. We also derive the corresponding approximate posterior inference algorithms using variational Bayes. Through experiments on datasets of newswire, medical journal articles, conference proceedings, and product reviews, we show that the HDSP results in a better predictive performance than labeled LDA, partially labeled LDA, and author topic model and a better negative review classification performance than the supervised topic model and SVM.",

  abstract = 	 {Sequence modeling with neural networks has lead to powerful models of symbolic music data. We address the problem of exploiting these models to reach creative musical goals, by combining with human input. To this end we generalise previous work, which sampled Markovian sequence models under the constraint that the sequence belong to the language of a given finite state machine provided by the human. We consider more expressive non-Markov models, thereby requiring approximate sampling which we provide in the form of an efficient sequential Monte Carlo method. In addition we provide and compare with a beam search strategy for conditional probability maximisation.
 Our algorithms are capable of convincingly re-harmonising famous musical works. To demonstrate this we provide visualisations, quantitative experiments, a human listening test and audio examples. We find both the sampling and optimisation procedures to be effective, yet complementary in character. For the case of highly permissive constraint sets, we find that sampling is to be preferred due to the overly regular nature of the optimisation based results. The generality of our algorithms permits countless other creative applications.}
